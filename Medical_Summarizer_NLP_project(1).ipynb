His comorbidities include hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive drugs and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has no significant allergies and never underwent any surgical procedure. He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery. We therefore saw the patient in clinic and discussed the procedure. Informed consent was signed, and liver function was tested using ICG retention rate. We used 0.5 mg/Kg corresponding to 40 mg in this 80 kg patient. The DICOM data of the CT scan of the patient were then submitted to our radiologist who performed a 3D reconstruction of the patient\\u2019s anatomy and the relationship of the lesion with the major vessels.

Patient\\u2019s past medical history was unremarkable. Post-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed two lesions (kissing tumors) in the upper esophagus, causing the tracheal shift to the right side with no lymph node enlargement (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and the results of laboratory examinations were within the normal range. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy evaluation of the mass showed a few pleomorphic spindle malignant cells among inflammatory cells in a bloody background. Additional endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was performed for the patient, which showed a large tumor in the cricopharyngeus causing stricture, while the stomach and duodenum were normal. (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy with the exploration of cervical organs, resection of the pharynx, thyroid (partial), and esophagus and gastric pull up along with the insertion of a tracheostomy and bilateral chest tube, and cervical penrose.\\nThe patient was laid in a supine position. After preparation and sterilization, the abdomen was opened by a high midline incision. The surgeon inserted his finger into the mediastinum to assess the presence of any tumors. Stomach was mobilized by harmonic ligasure, lesser sac was opened, short gastric and left gastric arteries were ligated, and gastric pedicle was made on the right gastroepiploic arteries and epigastric area. Then, the esophagus was dissected bluntly by the finger in the mediastinum through the hiatus's opening and continued upward. Adhesion to the carina was found and released meticulously.

She had an intrauterine death at 28 weeks\\u2019 gestation.\\nOn physical examination, she presented in both lower limbs swelling. A venous color flow Doppler ultrasonography of the both lower-extremity were requested, showing bilateral venous insufficiency, but there were not peripheral venous thrombosis. On auscultation, fixed split of second heart sound and pansystolic murmur on the left side of sternal border were heard. ECG was NSR. A chest X-ray showed mild heart enlargement. Echocardiography documented enlargement of the right ventricle and both atria with atrial septal defect (approximately 33 \\u00d7 38 mm) and normal function of both ventricles (). Right-sided pulmonary veins were not identified. Multidetector Computerized Tomography (CT) angiography confirmed atrial septal defect and abnormal return of right-sided pulmonary veins into the right atrium () and showed inferior vena cava on the right side of spine and showed total interruption of IVC below the hepatic veins (). Multidetector CT angiography provided full description of a complex anomaly documenting right inferior vena cava with azygous continuation, draining into the superior vena cava (, ) and hepatic veins were draining directly into the right atrium (). Ultrasound revealed polysplenia (), 0.5 cm nodule in the left thyroid lobe and 1 cm cystic mass in the right over.\\nA standard median sternotomy was performed. The pericardial cavity was opened and the heart was exposed. SVC was dissected out to the bridging vein, exposing the azygos vein and anomalous pulmonary veins.

And what about the fibrosis?\\nPatient's family: It was limited to her hands without involvement of her head or neck.\\nDoctor: I see. Is there any family history of any neuromuscular disease?\\nPatient's family: No, there wasn't.\\nDoctor: Alright. Can you tell me more about her right foot pain?\\nPatient's family: One month before visiting your hospital, she developed right foot gangrene. Although she had Raynaud's phenomenon and ulcerations in her fingers, she had no symptom in her foot before she had gangrene. The pain was so severe that she used tramadol and NSAIDs as painkillers.\\nDoctor: I see. And when did she start to complain about DHS?\\nPatient's family: It was when her foot pain worsened. She had difficulty in keeping her head straight and her gaze forward.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe her neck deformity?\\nPatient's family: Clinical examination revealed severe weakness of her neck extensor muscles. Her neck deformity was flexible and easily corrected passively.\\nDoctor: I see. And were there any neurological abnormalities including sensory disturbance or muscle weakness in her extremities?\\nPatient's family: No, there weren't.\\nDoctor: Alright. And what did the radiographs of her cervical spine reveal?\\nPatient's family: They revealed only mild degenerative changes and severe cervical kyphosis.\\nDoctor: I see. And what about her cervical magnetic resonance imaging?\\nPatient's family: It showed no spinal canal stenosis and no abnormal signal change in the cervical paraspinal muscles.\\nDoctor: I see. And what did the computed tomographic angiography show?\\nPatient's family: It showed occlusion of bilateral anterior tibial arteries and peroneal arteries, and development of collaterals.\\nDoctor: I see. Despite intensive conservative therapy including alprostadil, argatroban, and sarpogrelate, lower extremity ischemia progressed, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Alright. So, we decided to amputate her leg below the knee under general anesthesia, correct?\\nPatient's family: Yes.\\nDoctor: And her postoperative course was uneventful, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was.\\nDoctor: Good. And her severe foot pain was resolved after the surgery, correct?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was.\\nDoctor: And at the postoperative follow-up visit 3 weeks after surgery, her DHS was significantly attenuated, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was. Her forward vision and neck pain were also improved.\\nDoctor: That's great to hear. The feature of the present patient was attenuation of her DHS after pain relief by amputation of her severely ischemic limb.\\nPatient's family: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to inform you that your mother eventually passed away.\\nPatient's family: Thank you for your help, doctor.\\n[Conversation ends]\\n[Note: The patient eventually died.]\\n[Conversation Starts]\\nDoctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?\\nPatient's family: Our mother was referred to your department with a 1-month history of DHS.\\nDoctor: I see.

And what about the fibrosis?\\nPatient's\",\n          \"Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. What brings you to the ED today?\\nPatient: I was in a road traffic accident and I have severe pain in my right hip and right thigh.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you walk?\\nPatient: No, I can't.\\nDoctor: Okay. Let me have a look. Can you describe the pain you're feeling?\\nPatient: It's really bad. I can't move my right hip and thigh.\\nDoctor: Hmm, I understand. During our clinical examination, we found that you have a deformity of your right hip and thigh. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: And it seems that your leg and foot are showing external rotation and abduction, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: There is also tenderness and abnormal mobility at your right thigh, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: And is there tenderness at your right hip joint as well?\\nPatient: Yes, there is.\\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. We also found that the range of movements at your right hip is restricted and painful, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Great. And we didn't find any distal neurovascular de\\ufb01cit, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: After providing advanced trauma life support, we sent you for radiography, including X-rays of your pelvis with both hips and of your right thigh with hip and knee. And we also did a CT scan of your hip and pelvis to exclude acetabulum fractures.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: And after reviewing the radiographs, we confirmed that there was a fracture in the shaft of your femur and a posterior dislocation in your hip.\\nPatient: Oh no.\\nDoctor: Yes, I'm afraid so. We took you to an emergency OT and subjected you to closed manipulation of your hip joint. But as there was a fracture in the shaft of your femur, we were unable to reduce the hip dislocation.\\nPatient: What does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means that we had two options: open reduction and external \\ufb01xation, and closed manipulation of the dislocation of your hip joint. In the end, we placed a temporary external \\ufb01xator in your femur under anesthesia and performed closed manipulation and reduction of the dislocation of your hip using the Allis method.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: And the day after, we subjected you to final \\ufb01xation of your femur shaft fracture in an elective OT. We fixed the fracture with a closed reduction and an internal \\ufb01xation.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\\nDoctor: Great. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. And you should avoid putting weight on your right leg for the time being.\\nPatient: Okay, got it.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not so good, doctor. I have been experiencing some pain and swelling in my wrist and ankle joints for the past two weeks.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Sure, I have been experiencing some joint pain, swelling, and stiffness in both my wrist and ankle joints.\\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?\\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy about a year ago and have been on multidrug therapy since then.\\nDoctor: I see. And you're saying that you've been experiencing these joint symptoms for the past two weeks?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Alright, let me take a look. [Examines patient's joint]\\nDoctor: I can see some thickening and tenderness in your tendons. But there doesn't seem to be any joint deformity.\\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of recurrent crops of tender nodular lesions during and after my therapy.\\nDoctor: I see. We did a magnetic resonance imaging on your right ankle joint to evaluate the tenosynovitis and it showed some small focal peritendinous fluid collections along the flexor digitorium longus tendon and minimal fluid around the ankle joint.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: We also did a fine-needle aspiration cytology from the affected nerve and it revealed the presence of foamy macrophages and acid-fast bacilli.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that as well.\\nDoctor: The PCR from the isolates confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium leprae. So, we diagnosed you with leprosy presenting with tenosynovitis and erythema nodosum leprosum.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: We started you on the standard WHO multidrug therapy for leprosy, but you didn't respond well to it. So, we gave you a combination therapy of thalidomide 200 mg per day and prednisone 50 mg per day. But even that didn't help.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: That's why we started you on infliximab after doing a pre-biologic workup including chest X-Ray and viral serologies.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that too.\\nDoctor: Infliximab was given at a dose of 250 mg diluted in normal saline with dosing schedule at baseline and weeks 2 and 6. The treatment was well-tolerated and you showed good improvement in your symptoms.\\nPatient: Yes, I did feel better after taking infliximab.\\nDoctor: Great. We followed you up for 6 months and there was no recurrence of erythema nodosum leprosum.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. Thank you, doctor.\\nDoctor: No problem.

[\n          \"A 35-year-old G4P2 attended for reproductive surgery consultation to discuss a variety of problems she began to experience subsequent to undergoing the Essure\\u00ae procedure for permanent sterilization. HS was performed in October 2012 under general anesthesia; pre-procedure pelvic ultrasound was unremarkable. Before HS, the patient was in good general health and all of her pregnancies were established without medical assistance. Cervical cytology was routinely normal, the patient did not smoke and she never had a miscarriage. Soon after the Essure\\u00ae devices had been placed, the patient reported gradually increasing pelvic pain, headache, dizziness, lower extremity paresthesia and fatigue. In the first six months following the Essure\\u00ae procedure, the patient registered a 20 pound weight gain. The patient\\u2019s concerns persisted over a three-year interval, although her gynecologist was disinclined to attribute any of the problems to Essure\\u00ae.\\\\nThree months after HS, the patient presented for hysterosalpingogram as recommended. While the study did confirm bilateral tubal occlusion, it also revealed an abnormal (bifid) uterine cavity. 3-D ultrasound or other imaging was not performed to clarify or refine the diagnosis of the uterine anomaly and the patient received no further counseling.\\\\nThe patient later requested surgical removal of the Essure\\u00ae implants and the possibility of device migration required evaluation (). A repeat HSG was obtained in 2015. This study revealed minimal device migration and no contrast dye spill from either Fallopian tube, a deeply bifid uterine cavity was again the most conspicuous finding ().\\\\nAt our center the patient was counseled about the atypical nature of her Essure\\u00ae placement given the anatomical abnormality of the uterus. After obtaining informed consent, the patient underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy which verified an abnormal bifid uterus (). The ostia on the right was normal as was the entire right uterine segment. However, the Essure\\u00ae device on the left partially extended into the endometrial compartment (). The exterior uterus was consistent with ESHRE Class IIb anomaly (uterine septum) (). There was no evidence of tissue perforation by either contraceptive device. Laparoscopic dissection of the left cornu and partial tubal resection bilaterally achieved complete removal of the Essure\\u00ae implants. Removal of terminal markers was confirmed. Electrocautery was maintained at 40 W power throughout the case, blood loss was estimated to be less than 50 mL. The patient was discharged three hours after surgery and her postoperative convalescence has been uneventful.\",\n          \"A 72-year-old man presented with left hip pain and intermittent low grade fever, as well as occasional yellowish drainage from a sinus tract at the surgical incision of a cementless THA performed 4 years before at another hospital. Patient's past medical history was also significant for a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), performed one year prior to the current presentation. Prior use of steroids, a previous state of immunosuppression, or recent travel was not reported. The patient reported multiple prior hospital admissions due to drainage, allegedly attributed to a superficial infection and suppressed multiple times with multiple courses of per os and/or intravenous antibiotics including vancomycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole, only to recur a few months after each episode and antibiotics regimen. Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, AP and lateral hip radiographs as well as laboratory findings were consistent with PJI, as well as heterotopic ossification adjacent to the left hip joint (Fig. ). Preoperative cultures collected with wound swabs showed Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus capitis isolates of debatable clinical significance; cultures of synovial fluid aspiration were negative. With the assumptive diagnosis of PJI and septic loosening of the implants a joint decision was obtained for a staged THA revision.\\\\nThe patient was scheduled for the first stage THA revision 4 weeks after cessation of any antibiotics. Through a posterior hip approach, the femoral component was removed via a Paprosky-style extended proximal femoral osteotomy . Next, the acetabular cup and supporting screw were removed (Fig. ). Eight tissue samples were obtained from the bone, joint capsule and femoral canal for cultures, and the implants were sent for sonication. We routinely use sonication to identify bacteria in the biofilm on explanted implants, as this method has been found to be significantly more sensitive than tissue biopsy, while maintaining almost identical specificity , . A custom-made polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) hip spacer was fashioned and placed in the femoral lumen. We used gentamicin-loaded Palacos R+G\\u00ae bone cement (Zimmer, Inc. Warsaw, IN). When using an antibiotic loaded bone cement, we routinely admixture a second antibiotic (preferably vancomycin or other based on preoperative cultures and antibiogram, if available) to increase the local concentration of antibiotics and to obtain a synergistic effect, as adding a second antibiotic seems to increase the elution of both antibiotics , . The osteotomy was repaired with cerclage wires (Fig. ). The sinus tract was resected. The patient was given 600mg of teicoplanin iv intraoperatively and was subsequently started on a standing daily dose of the same regimen.\\\\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was afebrile without any wound healing problems. Partial weight bearing with a walker was started on postoperative day two, and progressed as tolerated. Intraoperative tissue cultures were negative. Sonication of the implant at 15 days showed Pseudomonas oryzihabitans bacterial isolate (Fig. ). Based on antibiotic susceptibilities, intravenous teicoplanin 600 mg and piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g qid was administered for 3 weeks, followed by ciprofloxacin 750 mg bid and clindamicin 600 mg qid for another four weeks, aiming for a second stage revision surgery. However, because of cardiovascular comorbidities, the patient was informed for the high risk associated with a second operation and did not consent for further surgery.\\\\nAt the last follow-up, 24 months after the first stage THA revision, the patient is well, without any clinical, laboratory or imaging evidence of infection; his wound healed completely, he could ambulate with crutches for short distances with mild pain, and inflammatory markers had reduced to normal values. Radiographs of the left hip joint showed a stable PMMA spacer, without any evidence of osteolysis or loosening, and with extensive periarticular heterotopic bone formation that obviously provided for the stability of the joint (Fig. ). The patient denied further surgery and remains at close follow-up for the risk of recurrent Pseudomonas oryzihabitans infection.\",\n          \"A 32-year-old woman was admitted to the gastroenterology department for upper abdominal pain. Gastroenteritis was continually managed using omeprazole. The treatment relieved her symptoms just a little. The symptoms of upper abdominal pain appeared intermittently for about 8 months. Repeated visits to the gastroenterology department and other departments in the local hospital were made. Omeprazole treatment for gastroenteritis was continued. However, the symptoms were still not improving. Finally, the patient went to the local gastrointestinal surgery department. The abdomen computed tomography examination was performed, which revealed that thrombosis had occurred in the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein (Fig. ). The thrombus did not improve even after repeated visits in gastrointestinal surgery and vascular surgery. The patient was referred to the Rheumatology Department in the hospital for the aggravation of abdominal pain, involving the whole abdomen.\\\\nThe patient had two abnormal abortions in past medical history. Abnormal physical examinations included total abdominal tenderness, rebound pain and muscle tension. The patient declined for abdominal palpation. Laboratory investigations showed raised APL (anti-\\u03b22GPI 143R U/mL, ACL IgM 70 U/mL, ACL IgG 20 U/mL). Renal biochemistry, hepatobiliary biochemistry, serum lipid profile, muscular enzymes and thyroid function were normal. Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed multiple thrombi in superior mesenteric vein and other vessels, dilatation of the small intestine and spleen infarction (Fig. ).\\\\nThe patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome based on clinical manifestations, past medical history and auxiliary examination results. The patient did not meet the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) diagnostic criteria. The patient claimed a previous pregnancy loss and presented with characteristics of high-risk APL (Table ). Moreover, the patient was affected by multiple abdominal vessels and viscus. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that the patient based on the 2019 EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults, was at high risk. The patient was administered with intravenous immunoglobulin (gamma globulin 40 mg daily) and glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone 40 mg daily) to limit further disease progression. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, enoxaparin 40 mg twice a day) therapeutic dose was used for anticoagulant therapy. Abdominal pain was significantly improved after systemic treatment. The patient was discharged and put on warfarin given orally 3 mg daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg daily, and hydroxychloroquine 0.2 g twice daily to be taken with food.\\\\nAfter months of discharge, the patient was later hospitalized with recurrent abdominal pain. The patient complained about nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, no defecation, and no exhaust during the last treatment in the Rheumatology Department. The abdominal computed tomography indicated incomplete ileus (Fig. ). Gastrointestinal decompression and conservative medical treatment were performed first. However, the therapeutic effect was not satisfactory. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the department of gastrointestinal surgery for surgical treatment. As for the reasons for the patient's admission, we consider the following two aspects: First, the patient had multiple mesenteric thromboses. Although anticoagulant therapy was applied, it could only prevent new thrombosis, the existing thrombosis could not be dissolved. Also, the collateral circulation was not completely established, leading to insufficient blood supply to the intestinal tract and non-mechanical obstruction. Second, although the patient regularly took warfarin anticoagulant therapy after discharge, the drug is greatly affected by diet and inconvenient monitoring, so the INR value outside the hospital was poorly controlled.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "article= '''A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.'''\n",

        "article= '''A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.'''\n",
